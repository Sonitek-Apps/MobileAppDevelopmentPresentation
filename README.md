##Introduction

Talk I gave for [WAJUG](http://wajug.be), the Walloon Java User Group.



####Talk Title
Mobile development strategies - The Good, the Bad and the Uglies....

###Talk Description
In this talk I go over the different ways of building mobile application and getting those applications out on the market onto all kinds of mobile devices.

I'll not only discuss native development on the primary mobile platforms, but I'll also take a closer look at the hybrid and web based approaches.

The focus isn't only on key technologies such as Java/Android/iOS/HTML5/PhoneGap/Appcelerator/Sencha/jQueryMobile/`<complete with other mobile buzzwords>`, but will also focus on TCO, 
platform affinity, quality, look and feel, design and the economics related to mobile development.

####Technical level
beginner / intermediary
